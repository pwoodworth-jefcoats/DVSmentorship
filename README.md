This repository holds projects for the Octâ€“Dec 2025 [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/) mentorship program.

At the moment, there's one project which is in the [AlohaHarvest](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats/DVSmentorship/tree/master/AlohaHarvest) 
folder.  It holds a (work in progress) closeread story about [Aloha Harvest](https://alohaharvest.org).  

Eventually, there will be a closeread CV (in a folder to be named CV) and hopefully a cool mapping project using leaflet (details TBD). 

This ReadMe will be updated as things come together.

This repository holds projects for the Octâ€“Dec 2025 [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/) mentorship program.

At the moment, there are two projects.  The one in the [AlohaHarvest](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats/DVSmentorship/tree/master/AlohaHarvest) 
folder holds a (work in progress) closeread story about [Aloha Harvest](https://alohaharvest.org). 
The one in the [CV](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats/DVSmentorship/tree/master/CV) folder
is an (also work in progress) closeread resume and CV combo. 

Hopefully there will also be a cool mapping project using leaflet (details TBD). 

This ReadMe will be updated as things come together.

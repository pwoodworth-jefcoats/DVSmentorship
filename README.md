This repository holds projects for the Oct–Dec 2025 [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/) mentorship program.

At the moment, there are two projects.  The one in the [AlohaHarvest](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats/DVSmentorship/tree/master/AlohaHarvest) 
folder holds a (work in progress) closeread story about [Aloha Harvest](https://alohaharvest.org). 
The one in the [CV](https://github.com/pwoodworth-jefcoats/DVSmentorship/tree/master/CV) folder
is an (also work in progress) closeread resume and CV combo. 

Hopefully there will also be a cool mapping project using leaflet (details TBD). 

Some updates from working on the CV project:  

* Closeread appears not to like headings that start with the letter _c_.  Strange. 
[Bug reported](https://github.com/qmd-lab/closeread/issues/187) and fingers crossed 
for a quick fix.  Until then, I'll use a placeholder heading.
* It doesn't look like ggiraph and treemapify work together:  
> Error in `geom_treemap_interactive()`:  
> ! could not find function "geom_treemap_interactive"  


This ReadMe will be updated as things come together.
